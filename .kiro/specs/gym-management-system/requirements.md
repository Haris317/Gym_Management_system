# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Gym Management System is a comprehensive MERN stack application designed to streamline operations for fitness centers. The system provides role-based access for three user types: administrators, trainers, and members. The existing implementation includes user authentication, class management, workout/diet plan distribution, payment processing, and basic admin functionality. This requirements document focuses on enhancing and completing the current system with improved features, better user experience, attendance tracking with QR codes, automated notifications, and mobile-responsive design.
